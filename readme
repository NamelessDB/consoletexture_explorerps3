It is basically like the console texture version of ps2, but ps3 version is easy to use (in offset you must put the bitmap offset in decimal or hex) you must also know the type of pixelformat that is the texture you want to visualize and extract, there are also the types of swizzle that are very important, you must know if your texture has swizzle or not (if when you unswizzle it looks good) when reimporting you need to unswizzle again (that is, it looks deformed again) it is rare but this happens in budokai 3 hd, it also has types of themes for the tool to put, it is very easy to use
